Assessment: Assignment #2: Huffman Coding

Running instructions: Git clone all the files from the huffman directory and run the make test to run the test on util.py. By doing so, it will run all tests involving compression and decompression using the util.py program. You can also run make pep8 to ensure the code meets the standards for formatting and style. To run the webserver for this assignment, change to the wwwroot directory and run python3 ../webserver to see the images for the decompressed files. To run the compressor individually using a custom file, add a copy of the file to the webserver directory and run python3 ../webserver <insert filename>. The decompressed version of this file can be found at http://<IP-address>:8000/<insert filename>.pdf.
