Assessment: Weekly Exercise #2: Unfair Dice

Running instructions: git clone the Directories and files "Drivers, Exercise, Expected, Makefile, README, submission_validator.py, and unfairDice.py" into your own repository and run the submission_validator.py program. Can be done by typing "python3 submission_validator.py". After this, you may type "make test" which will run the drivers and check to see if the code outputs the correct responses.

Notes and Assumptions: No notes or assumptions other than the ones listed in the assignment information document.
    Acknowledgements: Code from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-find-most-frequent-element-in-a-list/#:~:text=Make%20use%20of%20Python%20Counter,by%20using%20most_common()%20method. I used the mode function from this site as I was unsure of how to import mode (I now know it is done through importing the statistics function).
