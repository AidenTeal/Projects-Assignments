Assessment: Weekly Exercise #4: Text Preprocessor

Running instructions: Git clone all the files from the preprocess directory and run the make test to run the test on preprocess.py. Or, if you have your own inputs you would like to test, type in python3 preprocess.py <insert optional mode> into the command prompt, hit enter, and then provide your inputs, and it should provide an output with the desired results. You can also run make validate and make pep8 to make sure the code meets all other coding standards.

Notes and Assumptions: Assumptions are the same as the assumptions given in the assignment document. If an optional mode statement is given that does not match "keep-digits", "keep-symbols", or "keep-stops", program will give an error message that the mode is not valid, along with the correct modes that can be used. It will then exit the program while returning a main value of 1. Program also assumes that no additional command arguments are given (sys.argv[2] and greater). If one is given, the code will simply ignore it and only look at the first two values (sys.argv[0] and sys.argv[1]).
