Assessment: Weekly Exercise #1: Password Validator

Running instructions: In the directory containing passwordvalidate.py, specials.2022.txt, submission_validator.py, testwe1.py, README, and a Makefile, beginning by running the submission_validator.py in the multipass instance (python3 submission_validator.py). After this, you may move your driver program into the directory and then run "make test" to check the code to see its functionality. 

Note: If an input of < 8 is typed in for the generate function, the code will automatically change n to 8 so that a secure code can be made.

Acknowledgements:

In lines 73-74, 80-81, and 88-89, I use the shuffle function and join function to shuffle the list and then convert it back into a string. I was having a few errors at first with the proper set up of the function, so I researched into the function more on stack overflow.

Less than 10 lines were used but I thought I would site just incase.
